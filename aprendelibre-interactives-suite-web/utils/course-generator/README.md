Course Creation Workflow

This approach offers greater control and an opportunity to verify each course's structure before its release. Below is a proposed workflow:

1. Course Creation Script:
   Utilize a Node.js script (as an example) that prompts for essential course details upon execution, such as the course name, description, category, etc.
   Generate a UUID for the course and establish the required directory structure for the course's interactive elements.
   Copy default templates (if available) into the new course's directory. This might include foundational HTML, JS, CSS files shared across all courses.
   Store course metadata (name, description, UUID, creation date, etc.) within a JSON file inside the course directory or in a database if one is in use.

2. Integration with Azure Blob Storage:
   Should there be media files requiring storage in Azure Blob Storage (like videos or audios), the script could also handle these uploads.
   Ensure the script provides access URLs for these files on Azure Blob Storage so they can be referenced within your interactives.

3. Validation:
   Prior to finalizing the creation, the script might perform fundamental validations, such as ensuring no existing course shares the same name or verifying the presence of all necessary files.

4. Incorporation into the Main Project:
   Upon readiness of the course and proper structure establishment, one can incorporate its interactives and resources into the primary Nuxt.js project. Integrating the new course directory into your application's code could be as straightforward as referencing it.

5. Reusability:
   If there's a future intent to further automate the process or to enable other users to create courses, this script could serve as the foundation for a more sophisticated tool or a user interface with a similar function.
   By embracing this approach, one gains flexibility, detailed control over course creation, and the assurance that each course aligns with the set quality standards. It also paves the way for future expansion and further automation if desired.
